        <li>On this assignment, I struggled with remembering how to put an image on my site.  I tried a few times until I remembered that I had to put
            the "src" in front of the name of the picture.  I then had to downscale the image to a smaller size with the height and width tools.
            I relearned how to put an image on my site and how to put links to other pages.
